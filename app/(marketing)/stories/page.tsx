            Carlos Tevez — Real Estate Operator
          </h2>
  
          <p>
            Carlos Tevez didn’t think he had a discipline problem. From the outside,
            things looked fine.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            He was active in real estate—reviewing opportunities, talking to brokers,
            managing deals. But when he looked honestly at his days, the pattern was
            clear: focus was inconsistent. Some days he reviewed deals deeply. Other
            days he reacted to messages, scrolled social media, and told himself he’d
            get to it tomorrow.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            He decided to test one simple rule using Continuum:
            <strong> review at least one deal every day, no matter what.</strong>
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Not five deals. Not a full analysis. Just one, done properly.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Carlos also made two supporting changes. He flagged excessive social media
            use as a negative habit. Reading replaced it. Physical training became
            binary—either completed or not. Every day was logged, even the bad ones.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            The score didn’t judge him, but it didn’t lie either.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Within a few weeks, the pattern became uncomfortable. On days he slipped
            into social media, deal reviews were rushed or skipped entirely. On days
            he followed the system, focus improved and decisions felt cleaner.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Over the next few months, the output spoke for itself. Carlos reviewed more
            deals than he had the entire previous year. Follow-ups became faster.
            Hesitation disappeared.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            When a strong opportunity appeared, he recognized it immediately and
            moved. That deal closed.
          </p>
  
          <p className="text-gray-400">
            Continuum didn’t change Carlos’s life overnight. It enforced standards
            when motivation wasn’t present—and made progress unavoidable.
