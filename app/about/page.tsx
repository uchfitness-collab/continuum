        <p style={{ fontSize: 18, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          <strong>Continuum</strong> is a personal operating system designed to
          measure, reinforce, and compound daily discipline.
        </p>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 16, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          Most people don’t fail because they lack ambition. They fail because they
          lack <strong>structure</strong>. Continuum exists to solve that problem.
        </p>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 16, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          It converts your daily actions into a single evolving metric — the
          <strong> Sovereign Score</strong> — so you can see, in real time, whether
          you are becoming who you say you want to be.

        <h2>Why Habits Matter</h2>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 12, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          James Clear wrote, “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person
          you wish to become.” The problem is that most people never track their
          votes.
        </p>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 12, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          They rely on memory, emotion, or motivation — all unreliable. Continuum
          removes ambiguity. It replaces feelings with feedback.
        </p>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 12, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          You don’t guess whether you’re disciplined. You <strong>see it</strong>.
        </p>
  
        <hr style={{ margin: '48px 0' }} />
  
        <h2>The Philosophy Behind Continuum</h2>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 12, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          Jim Rohn famously said, “Discipline is the bridge between goals and
          accomplishment.” Continuum is that bridge — built daily, one action at a
          time.
        </p>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 12, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          Bob Proctor taught, “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall
          to the level of your habits.” Continuum ensures you don’t fall blindly.
          You descend — or rise — with awareness.
        </p>

        <h2>How Continuum Works</h2>
  
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: 24 }}>The Three Pillars</h3>
  
        <ul style={{ marginTop: 12, lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
          <li>
            <strong>Body</strong> — physical discipline, nutrition, and effort
            output
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mind</strong> — focus, restraint, and daily discipline rating
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Identity</strong> — actions that build your future self
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 16, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          Each day, your inputs are converted into a <strong>Daily Raw Score</strong>.
          That score feeds into your <strong>Sovereign Score</strong>, a weighted
          moving average that rewards consistency — not perfection.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Use Continuum</h2>
  
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: 24 }}>1. Define Your Habits</h3>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          On the Habits page, you define your standards. What counts as effort?
          What are you avoiding? What action moves you forward?
        </p>
  
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: 24 }}>2. Log Your Day</h3>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          Each day, you log what actually happened. No stories. No excuses. Just
          truth.
        </p>
  
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: 24 }}>3. Review the Dashboard</h3>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          Your dashboard shows your trajectory, averages, baseline comparison,
          and whether discipline is compounding or eroding.
        </p>
  
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: 24 }}>4. Reflect Weekly</h3>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          Once per week, you step back. Did you show up? What worked? What didn’t?
          What pattern emerged?
        </p>
  
        <hr style={{ margin: '48px 0' }} />
  
        <h2>Who Continuum Is For</h2>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 12, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          Continuum is for people who take responsibility seriously, value truth
          over motivation, and believe discipline is freedom.
        </p>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 12, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          It is not a streak app. It is not gamification. It is a mirror.
        </p>
  
        <hr style={{ margin: '48px 0' }} />
  
        <h2>Final Thought</h2>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 12, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          You don’t need more motivation. You need visibility.
        </p>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 12, lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
          Every day, you cast a vote. Continuum simply counts them.
        </p>
